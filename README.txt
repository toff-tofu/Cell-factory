Overview:

Photosynthesis and cellular respiration are two very important processes for plants. They produce the ATP plants needed for energy. Photosynthesis happens in the chloroplast, an organelle containing stacks of thylakoids, called grana. The light reactions, the first part of photosynthesis, happens in the thylakoids to produce the ATP and NADPH needed in the Calvin Cycle, which happens in the stroma of the chloroplast, outside the thylakoids but inside the chloroplast. The Calvin Cycle produces the glucose that cellular respiration needs to make ATP. The equation for photosynthesis is 6CO2 + 6H2O + energy from light → C6H12O6 + 6O2. Basically, 6 carbon dioxide molecules, 6 water molecules, and some photons, sunlight energy, go in, and it forms glucose, which is needed for cellular respiration, and 6 oxygen gas molecules, which are exhaled as a byproduct. The many different layers and membranes the chloroplast has makes it easier for the plant to have multiple cycles at the same time for maximum efficiency, as seen in the Calvin Cycle. Cellular respiration happens in the mitochondria, also known as the powerhouse of the cell, because this is where all the energy, ATP, is produced. Cellular respiration takes the glucose from photosynthesis and breaks it down further, making ATP. The mitochondria has a bean-like shape, maximizing the amount of membrane space and space in general to be able to produce more ATP. The equation for cellular respiration is C6H12O6 + 6O2 → 6CO2 + 6H2O + ATP. Basically, a glucose molecule and 6 molecules of oxygen gas go in, and 6 molecules of carbon dioxide, 6 molecules of water, and ATP are produced. The only thing that matters is the ATP, though, so the carbon dioxide and the water are pushed out of the plant. Photosynthesis and cellular respiration are inverses of each other, and together they provide a base for all life on Earth.


Light Reactions:

The light reactions occur inside the thylakoid membranes. They are called the light reactions because they need the energy coming from light to start the whole process. First, a photon from the sun comes in, exciting an electron in the special pair of chlorophyll in Photosystem II (PSII). This special pair is called P680, because it best absorbs light at wavelengths of 680 nm, a measurement of light. After the electron gets excited, it immediately gets passed to a primary electron acceptor which then moves it onto the electron transport chain (ETC). To replace the lost electron in the chlorophyll, water is split, taking an electron from the hydrogen, creating a proton, and the two oxygens are exhaled as a waste product. On the ETC, the electron slowly loses its energy and gets moved downwards, and the energy is used to pump protons across the membrane against the concentration gradient to create an electrochemical gradient. Since the protons don't want to be where they are and they can't diffuse through the membrane because they are charged, they diffuse through a special protein called ATP Synthase. As the protons go through ATP Synthase, it spins, grabs an ADP, and uses the energy from the spinning to attach a phosphate group to ADP, making ATP. After the electron gets lowered back to its original energy level, it goes to Photosystem I (PSI). There, an electron in the special pair of chlorophyll, this time P700, gets excited again by a photon. It gets grabbed by another primary electron acceptor, moving through several of them until it gets picked up by NADP+. NADP+ also picks up a hydrogen, making NADH. Now, the ATP and NADPH are sent to the Calvin Cycle to make glucose!


Calvin Cycle:

The Calvin Cycle occurs in the stroma of the chloroplast, outside the thylakoids but inside the chloroplast. First, a molecule of RuBisCo binds a carbon dioxide molecule to a five carbon chain of RuBP, because carbon dioxide is an inorganic molecule that plants can’t work with. Once it gets bonded it becomes organic carbon. This is called carbon fixation. Since the six carbon chain is unstable, it quickly splits into two three carbon chains, called PGA. Next, we reduce the PGAs into G3Ps, using the energy ATP and NADPH provide. The ATP and NADPH donate electrons to the G3Ps, and the ATP and NADPH get oxidized into ADP and NADP+ and go back to the light reactions. Then, you do this five more times, to get 12 G3Ps in total. Next, we set aside 2 G3Ps for glucose production, and the other five are used to generate the RuBP.


Glycolysis and Link Reaction:

During Glycolysis, there are two phases: the Energy Investment phase and the Energy Payoff Phase. Both of these phases happen in the cytosol located in the cytoplasm as its fluid part. Glycolysis requires 1 glucose molecule, 2 NAD+ which is an electron carrier,  2 ATP, four ADP, and 4 inorganic phosphate. 
During the Energy Investment phase, each ATP loses their last phosphate group and they become ADP. The first phosphate group is added to Glucose through the enzyme Hexokinas. The second phosphate is added to Glucose through the enzyme Phosphofructokinase,(PFK) preparing it to split. The Glucose molecule with 2 Phosphates attached is called Fructose-1, 6 Bisphosphate. The glucose then breaks down into 2 three carbon chains or Glyceraldehyde 3-Phosphate(G3P). The process of Glucose breaking down is known as Lysis.
During the Energy Payoff Phase, the 3 carbon chains are oxidized and they each lose an electron and H+ to NAD+ turning them into NADH. This process is known as Oxidation. During Oxidation, an additional phosphate is attached to each of the carbon chains. 4 ADPs then take the phosphates from the carbon chains and become ATP. This transfer of phosphate from a high-energy substrate molecule(the carbon chain) to ADP, is known as Substrate level phosphorylation. This is done in a process called Phosphorylation which creates 2 NADH, 4 ATP(NET 2 ATP), and 2 Pyruvate(3 carbon chains).
The Link Reaction requires 2 Pyruvate, 2 NAD+, and 2 CoA. During the Link Reaction in the Mitochondria’s Mitochondrial Matrix, Pyruvate is oxidized, which transfers electrons to NAD+ reducing it to NADH. As pyruvate is oxidized a CoA is added to each pyruvate molecule, creating Acetyl CoA and CO2 as a byproduct. The CO2 is breathed out and the Acetyl CoA is moved into the Krebs Cycle. The Link Reaction produces 2 Acetyl CoA and 2 NADH with 2 Co2 as a byproduct.

Electron transport chain:

The ETC takes place in the mitochondria in the inner mitochondrial membrane between the mitochondrial matrix and the intermembrane space. To start, NADH will drop off its electrons and a proton at protein complex I, oxidizing and turning into NAD+; the two high-energy electrons pump protons across the membrane into the intermembrane space. Next, the electrons travel to coenzyme Q, which transports them to protein complex II, where FADH2 drops off its electrons, becoming FAD and oxidizing coenzyme Q to QH2, now carrying all the electrons. Coenzyme Q transports them to complex III, pumping more protons into the intermembrane space. Now, cytochrome C will take the electrons from complex III and take them to complex IV, where the final protons are pumped, and molecular oxygen (O2) takes the electrons from the bottom of the chain. It takes the 4 electrons and grabs 4 protons, making 2 H2O. Now, the intermembrane space is full of protons all jammed together. Pumping the protons across through active transport made an electrochemical gradient, and now all the protons want to diffuse back across the membrane. But since they are ions, they have to go through facilitated diffusion through ATP synthase. ATP synthase uses the flow of protons through its axel to make ATP by bonding a phosphate group with ADP. First, after ATP is released, ADP and a phosphate group diffuse into the active site, where a bond between them is formed using the energy from the F0 complex from the protons going through facilitated diffusion. Once they are bonded, the site opens up for the ATP to get out and new ADP and phosphate groups to come in. This happens at three different areas around the hexamer in the F1 complex.
